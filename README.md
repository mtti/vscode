This repository contains my personal configuration for Visual Studio Code. It's available here in public so that I always have easy access to it. I don't expect it to be useful to anyone else.

It's debatable whether anything in this repo is actually copyrightable (other than perhaps this README file) but in case something is, this repository is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
