This repository contains my personal configuration for Visual Studio Code. It's available here in public so that I always have easy access to it. I don't expect it to be useful to anyone else.

## Where to clone this?

* Windows: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`
* macOS: `/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
* Linux: ???
